The walnut almost perfectly matches the wood of my desk (differences in finishes aside; I can&#39;t expect the seller to use tung oil). The included woolen strips help to make each slot perfect for my laptops, both my chunky government one and my thin MBP. The stand hasn&#39;t moved, so whatever they put on the bottom to keep it in place is great. Highly recommend this.",

        "reviewBody": "First off, I would like to say that I have been in search of new office products for the last two months because I am in the middle of re-doing my home office. I was debating on the wooden laptop riser from Grovemade and this laptop stand. I chose this laptop stand because I felt it was better looking than the Grovemade product, the wood on this one popped more and once I received the product from Oakywood, I was not disappointed at all. This laptop riser/stand is very high quality, I was very impressed with the packaging as well, they definitely take great pride in their products at Oakywood. Although I am not keeping the product, it is not because I do not like it, it&#39;s because, for the height of my desk, the stand holds my laptop up too high for my height and I end up looking up a little too much. Customer service is great!",
