Any professional video editing software, photo editing software, or other advanced software, I would look into the M2 Pro editions.\n\nHope this helps!",

          "Delivery times are never accurate. Bestbuy has changed my delivery date 5 times already. Honestly will never order from bestbuy again.",
          "Their delivery time is NEVER what they say it is. Can expect poor communication, lack of tracking updates, and late deliveries when you order from BestBuy. Can generally expect at least 2-4 days later than what they say it’ll be. Maybe it’s because I’ve been spoiled by Amazon fast and consistent deliveries but, regardless, I don’t plan on ordering from BestBuy again.",
          "Best Buy is horrible with shipping. Will never ever be shopping here again.",
          "Nobody knows anything when you contact support other than it’s not being delivered on time. I will never order from Best Buy again and will stick to competent companies like Amazon.",
          "TERRIBLE WITH STORE PICKUP!!! Ive been waiting days for my order, absolutely no updates from the company. NEVER AGAIN!",
          "Best Buy blatantly lies about delivery time. They said next-day delivery at time of purchase however it's been two days and the item is still \"awaiting pickup from the carrier\" and they refuse to give me an ETA. I asked if I could go pick up the item from the store or warehouse instead and they said no. I asked if I could speak with the customer representative's supervisor, and she said they would only give me the same answer anyway. I insisted and she then transferred me to some phone directory that required input of an extension number I was never provided. Clearly, this representative was trying to give me the runaround. Atrocious customer service. Will not buy from this company again.",
          "This company is so garbage in shipping. They will give you a shipping date and then delay it the day of delivery . Provide no shipping label because there lazy reps can’t put a label on a item and drop ship it for two weeks. Horrible experience. I assure you Best Buy will have no option after 2021 . They will make the change to allow shipped items available for pickups when delayed shipping is last minute. There Stock is going to plummet. Remember I said this. You’ll see public articles on this horrible shipping issue they seem to have. Customers waiting and waiting and waiting. Don’t buy from Best Buy. They are horrible on integrity and it’s catching up to them . They must not see all the horrible shipping issues with the customers items stocked at surrounding stores. Google is logging dozens of the same complaints on there platform.",
          "Their store pickup is a joke, they have one or 2 people picking items during holiday season in 2021. The best buy I went to had a line out the door with people waiting for their \"one hour pick up\" promise. They should remove it and stop pretending they can fulfill these orders. I'd rather order from Amazon next time and have it delivered accurately next day. Not same day and I'm sitting here 3 days after with not even an update email.",
          "No. I was told in store when I purchased a washer and dryer that it would be delivered in 3 weeks, Cancelled by Best Buy. Then rescheduled for 2 weeks later, received 2 emails confirming, received a text confirming, received a phone call confirming and waited all day after moving everything so they could get them in, never showed up and never contacted me to tell me they were not coming, I had to call them to find out what was going on which was a major hassle. Now rescheduled again with same thing, already received one email confirming, we shall see. So, to answer your question, ordered in July with promised delivery in 2 weeks, it's now September and I still have no appliances and they have actually billed my credit card. I am going to call them this time and see if they actually have the items and are going to deliver them before I move all this stuff and sit home all day waiting for a no show.",
          "The answer is NO. They didn't come right and accurate time(7AM to 1PM) as they promised.\r\nThe delivery man came almost near 10 PM without any notice (except for 5 minutes before he arrive) \r\nso I had to wait for all day long and couldn't do anything because of this.",
          "As I sit here and type this, I’m without a television that Best Buy stated would be delivered today. I ordered this item from Best Buy - and not Amazon - specifically because the company stated it would arrive sooner. I chatted online with a representative today - he told me the order would arrive on time. And yet, here we are. \n\nSo this will be the last time I opt against Amazon for Best Buy.",
          "Don't trust them!! They can't get it when they say if they even can. When you call to even find where your order is they must not even be able to know themselves because they always have some totally different story so they must be making stuff up! Order still delayed and don't even know if anything is on its way. But they sure took my $900 as fast as possible! What a joke!!",
          "I needed an item asap.Best Buy says get it next day . So I used them instead of Amazon. Of course my item is delayed. Ruined what I needed to accomplish,ish. Last time I use these jokers.",
          "You know I try not to be negative and give people passes because of the holiday season and staff shortages but I will never order online again for delivery. I ordered a $2,000 PC Tuesday for Friday free delivery, they email me Thursday at noon saying that it couldn’t be shipped to my location (even tho everyone else seems to be able to). I was semi annoyed but things happen so I go to order again and it just so happens that my coupon expires that was $200 off and now they want $100 for next day shipping since I needed it by Friday. So I payed extra for everything and my order was delayed and it’s now Monday and it hasn’t even shipped lol. I’ve never had to try so hard to get someone to take $2k from me.",
          "No, they are not accurate",
          "Delayed order. I wish they would kept us up to date even after it gets delayed. All I was notified that it was in a warehouse and location. My order came 3 days later than the time it was given to me.",
          "Don't believe the \"delivery date\" on popular products and you can't trust them even when order shows \"delivered\". Spent 2.5 hours today between BB Chat, UPS Chat, and BB phone support to no avail, had to get a refund. Ordered Oct. 1, showed shipped Oct. 6 for Oct. 7 delivery. Item sat, and sat some more, 5 days later UPS still shows \"label created\" and doesn't show picked up. BB has 3 stories, one said it shipped but just hasn't updated at UPS, another said it didn't ship because UPS delayed the pickup (5 days, really?), third one never said exactly, just that she could \"re-ship\" or refund. Got my money back, at least I hope so, still waiting on that too.",
          "HORRIBLE SHIPPING.  I WILL NEVER ORDER ONLINE HERE AGAIN.  SHIPPING DATES ARE NEVER ACCURATE.  YOU ORDER AN ITEM FOR NEXT DAY DELIVERY, AND YOU ARE LUCKY TO GET IT IN A WEEK OR MORE!!!!",
          "I purchased a laptop for school on Tuesday 1/11/21 and said it was next day delivery. They outsourced the delivery with a company called roadie and tried to deliver it while I was at work (signature required) so it got returned and told me call the sender (Best Buy) to set up another deliver. The gentleman I spoke to said I could pick up the laptop at the store the same day. HA. Got an email stating they were out of stock and would let me know when they are restocked. I called again and the lady I spoke to said to ignore the email that it would still be available. Well went to go pick it up, the lady working the in store pick up counter was very rude and said I needed to wait until I got an email stating that the order was ready for pick up. I’ve checked in every day and spoke to 2 more people and they said the same thing “it’s being prepared and to wait for the email confirming it’s ready” it’s been stuck in “preparing we’ll let you know when it’s ready”. It’s now 1/17/21 and online school starts tomorrow with no laptop in sight. They also refunded the amount I paid for it in store and when I asked all of the customer service reps if I’ll need to repay at the store they all say no..make that make sense.",
          "No, the in store pick up dates and shipping dates are not accurate and for in store pickups they will not update online pickup date estimates or inform you of delays unless you call. \nYou can only get tracking info for in-store pickups if you call and they'll never own up to the inaccuracy of their estimates. You'll just get your item late and need to be alright with that",
          "I guess I got lucky, received my package when they said. After reading the reviews though I would probably just pickup in store when they get more inventory",
          "I thank you all for posting your comments! I just canceled my order based on all your comments. This is totally unacceptable!",
          "HAHAHAHA!!! Best Buy is the WORST for accurate delivery times. I have not had ONE a order deliver on time this year and it’s not the fault of the shipping companies. If it’s suppossed to delivery to me on December 10th, they won’t even ship it until December 10th. Thi place is a joke. Do not order from them you will regret it. I’m an elite platinum plus or whatever they call it and they don’t give a crap when you call. Stay AWAY FROM BEST BUY. Go to amazon, target, WM, he’ll build it yourself and you will get it quicker. Used to love Best Buy, now I hate them",
          "Nope. I ordered a phone case one time, after 3 weeks of waiting for a 3 day delivery, I finally called to get my money back. 2 months AFTER that, my phone case that I was refunded for showed up to an address I don't even live at anymore, and the current residents contacted me to tell me the package showed up. I did not feel at all bad about keeping that free phone case lol. Currently waiting on an expensive laptop that I'm sure I will be waiting past the promised time for. Company is quite a joke.",
          "Ordered a product January 6, 2022 that clearly stated \"Next Day Delivery.\" Two weeks later, still waiting. Tracking just says delivery delayed with no estimated time of delivery. Called customer service twice. Clueless. Unable to cancel order or choose pick up on website. I'm freakin stuck waiting and all customer service phone numbers go to same reps who can't help. OUTRAGEOUS!",
          "I'm returning my product as soon as it gets delivered and ordering from other store and will wait. Just out of principle. Was excited and now am annoyed and bummed. They had the nerve to say my door was inaccessible while I sat in front of the house all day waiting. Surprise to me when I kept checking tracking, at 7pm says they attempted and I looked around, like... when...?",
          "I could not take my midterm because of Best buy. Never trusting their shipping times... I bought a computer from here because the it said they will deliver in two days (because I needed it for my lab classes asap) but then it's been two weeks so now yea I missed my midterm. You cant even cancel the product",
          "SO far im still waiting for my item to become ready for pick up the day it said it would be ready, first time if they fail me this has happened. I also bought a 30 series graphics card so that might be the issue here biting at the bits for the dang thing to be ready",
          "Even paying 25$ extra the item will be delivered later that promised. 3 days later actually han promised. We bought a camera and couldn’t take it to our trip. So the camera is returned. Their loss!",
          "Terrible. Ordered four days ago and they still haven't shipped my item. Will never use again!",
          "Nughtmare, Nightmare, Nightmare. I needed a printer. Their website says \"Order Now and you'll get it today\" after I paid for it my email said said \"you'll receive it tomorrow\" Went back to the original screen, and it still says that it's available today. So I waited, and then what they were calling \"tomorrow\" I got another email that said 24 - 48 hours... and still when I return the web page it is still claiming same day delievery.  So I droveabout 20 minutes away, bought the printer, and now I can't cancel the original order from my account. I paid the extra for the totaltech support. Gosh, I feel that I've been cheated.",
          "Best Buy is never accurate. My package has been delayed, it was supposed to arrive yesterday but now I’m HOPING that it comes in today because I spent a big load of money for it.",
          "My delivery was middle of June and then was to be delivered July 6 and still no tv and can’t tell me where it is or when I will receive it",
          "If it’s not in store go to amazon or somewhere else because shipping is ridiculous! I enjoy curbside when I know it’s in store but anything shipping I will always refuse. Never get anything on time. At least send a gift card for doubling making out our wait time over and over because we just wanna know where our packages are at and not told grey stories. No tracking info, no real ETA, and not very good customer service when it comes to shipping.",
          "They’re never accurate especially sight to store. Order from somewhere else. Paid $1700 for something and can’t even get an estimate from staff or the app. Nice letdown",
          "Absolutely not. Best Buy knowingly lies about shipping time and it’s infuriating. Even if you pay for “Next Day” it typically comes 3-4 days later. This has happened to me enough times to be embarrassed I continued to trust them so long. I know Amazon is destroying their business but it’s still crazy that a company as big as theirs can blatantly lie about shipping times and get away with it.",
          "No. My laptop broke so I ordered a new one on Saturday with a guaranteed delivery by Sunday at 9 pm. I'm now having to call out from work until it arrives. They also didn't have in store pick up only this \"same day\" delivery and the customer service closes an hour before the delivery window closes so you can't even find out if its delayed so it's safe to do other things.",
          "Ordered a rangetop back in July for a September delivery. Never showed. Have since been contacted six times for rescheduling. Finally, thought everything was good for a Thanksgiving eve delivery. NOPE! Foiled again. Web site currently states an early December delivery, but Geek rep tells me maybe in April!!!! Cancelled then and there. Seems like a total bait & switch for delivery times. Done with Best Buy.",
          "Im store pickup sucks.  They never send any updates or emails that the order is ready.  Employees refuse to grab your item if you come before you receive “the email” even if the item is on the floor.  Eventually got a store manager to grab the order after making a second trip and explaining the item was nearly sold out.  I would never do in store pickup from them again.  Literally witnessed another guy whos in store pickup was sold out by the time he tried to grab it.  They dont hold items to prevent this, but will hold your money in the process",
          "Never order anything for delivery from this god awful company, unless you want to wait multiple weeks in delays to get the wrong item",
          "Our fridge/freezer went out Bought mini fridge from Best buy because it said next day delivery.Next day get notice it is delayed.Called CS at 8 am and said if item is not coming I want to cancel.-outsourced rep tells me he spoke with carrier and it will be delivered same day as promised.Waited until noon -still no tracking update-called carrier and find they have no update and nothing for my address Best Buy rep LIED.Called Best Buy back and another rep says delivery expected in 2 weeks-I asked to cancel order and rep says not possible-my fridge is leaking my food is wasted and THIS COMPANY IS TERRIBLE!! POOR CS REPS LYING TO TRY AND COVER THEIR BS-and website still says item will be delivered the next day!Disgusted with this company",
          "Very disappointed in the shipping. I ordered a desktop in the store for pickup since they said it wasn’t in stock at that location. Now 3 weeks later I am on my 3rd delay and the only way know it’s been delayed so many times is because right had to go to the store and talk to customer service. Other than my attempts to find out what is taking it so long I would have no idea because there are no updates other than it saying delayed and they will email me when it’s ready. Very disappointed in my experience with a large company like this.",
          "Nope. Had an order arrive 4 days earlier and now have an order that is 4 days late with no estimated new date and nobody at best but has a clue. They tell me they can’t track store orders. SMH.",
          "NO.  They sent my 3000.00 order to another state over 8 hours away, then hung up on me 3 times when I tried to call the customer service.  Once I did get someone, I was told they wanted my credit card for verification.  I will NEVER EVER be shopping here again NOR will I recommend this to ANYONE.  Best Buy is nothing but an unorganized dumpster fire.",
          "Best Buy shipping is terrible and the reps doesn't help at all. They don't even know what to say apart from \"I'm sorry\" \"I understand\". They don't understand nothing. They don't work with the cuatomer. Don't be \"sorry\" and fix things so you don't have to be sorry about it. Definitely getting other options to buy from.",
          "best buy took my money ripped me off ordered something on line they said it would be here the next day never came now there saying a week stole my money never do business with them again",
          "HORRIBLE! I understand the holiday season is a mess and carriers are slammed, but why has my package been sitting in the same location for the past 6 DAYS?!?! You’re telling me in almost a week, my item hasn’t left the store it’s being fulfilled from? Okay…the associate insisted my gift would be here by the 24th and I will be utterly shocked if it arrives by Christmas considering it’s still in California. LAST TIME SHOPPING FROM BEST BUY! You wonder why Amazon has you all beat…",
          "It is not accurate at all, and if you call them, they will say it’s going to be delivered on time, even though tracking shows it’s still states away, and not even picked up by UPS. Buyers BEWARE!",
          "They have cancelled 3 separate delivery/installations; each time without any notice to me.  Calling their customer service is a total waste of time particularly after waiting on hold for more 40 minutes each time.  Service representatives can't assist.  Still haven't gotten my TV's.  Very frustrating.  Would never order from them again.",
          "no they are horrible with shipping and  with in store  pickup. my order was delayed and they are taking forever with updated information. would not recommend. would advise to buy your stuff somewhere else.",
          "I just remembered that I ordered the a video game. It was supposed to be delivered on release day. It came 3-4 days after. Best Buy customer service was horrible! They wouldn’t allow me to cancel! One of the reps even mocked me. “I know how important it is for people to have their game on release day!” She said it sarcastically! The supervisor was of no help! No wonder Best Buy is in the shape they’re currently in now! I just canceled my order for a A95k television. Reading these comments reminded me what I went through and I just can’t deal with it again. The only difference this time is it’s delivery to a store. It still allowed me to cancel online. I don’t want a wait so long until that option may not be available!",
          "Ever since they started using Shipt there is no accountability and a high likelihood I don't get my order, then it gets stuck in their system so a refund takes a month to even start getting processed.\n\nDON'T SHIP THROUGH BEST BUY",
          "My package was suppose to be here today and they basically told me I can’t do anything about it until 2 weeks. So they said it could take two weeks to get even though the store is within driving distance. Wish I had bought from store because I need a computer to work.",
          "DO NOT ORDER ANYTHING FOR DELIVERY FROM BEST BUY!! During the labor day sale we ordered, over the phone, an entire Samsung Kitchen appliance package for our lakehouse. It has become something from a bad Seinfeld episode. The order then went to the Bossier City, La store for delivery as it came in. All 4 pieces came in at different times, which meant different delivery times. Wouldn't of been a problem, except every delivery came with it's own plot line of problems. Delivery scheduled by the store or natl scheduling dept, no one shows up, no one calls, no text, no email. Then try to call store, you can't, goes to national number and they can't connect you to the store. They will see that it is/was scheduled, but can't talk to the actual store to see what happened. I drove the 45 min to store to figure out what is going on. Asst. store manager couldn't figure it out, he was on phone with his own national company rep for over 30 min. As I type this, the exact same thing has happened again on the last piece, the range. Have emailed 3 different managers at the Bossier store, still no response. And they were the ones that emailed my that the range was coming yesterday, which it didn't. Back on phone  with national, who can't talk to the store.  But they have rescheduled for the 18th, just like they did for the 3rd, but delivery time was never set by store. Then the 9th, but no one showed up. So now the 18th, by the national scheduling rep, but this time they are using a 3rd party delivery service, so who knows, maybe just maybe it might just work. You can't make this stuff up.",
          "Shipping time is not accurate.  They will say next day delivery and not even ship the item till a couple of days.  Don't rely on delivery estimate if you have to have the item quickly.",
          "I had ordered an apple watch Series 7 on Bestbuy which was rescheduled for over 3-4 times and finally had to order from Amazon which delivered my order on the specified date. The same is going on with my order for a magic keyboard for my iPad. Will never do an online order from Bestbuy again.",
          "delaying. very stressful.\nNever shop here again.",
          "They are trash at shipping, I ordered three products seperately and they screw up all three which is ridiculous and they will give to promises and ganrentee that the product \narrive on time, don't listen to any of them. To all people, go to B&H in the future, they are so much better at shipping, never got delayed shipment. Don't ever trust Best Buy when they say the products will arive on time.",
          "Not often. My most recent purchase was a pre-order for a video game and it came a whole day late. Happened to me with another pre-order of a game last year.",
          "Probably not -- I had a Totaltech subscription and tried to order an exercise machine. I was able to select a date for delivery/assembly services and finish my purchase, and then got a confirmation of that date. Less than 1 day later i got a text from best buy that the actual first available date was 5 weeks (!!) later. They continued to show the earlier date when i tried to make the same purchase again. A customer support person explained to me that they unfortunately change the relevant store that should provide the delivery/install services after you select your date. Seems shady and confusing - not sure i believe it! Bottom line, best buy knows when your REAL date is but won't tell you when you make your order!!",
          "Ya I ordered from there once for pick up and they managed to get my desk top on time but not the monitor like thanks guys, not like I need a monitor to use the desk top or anything what what's worse is they won't let me cancel it",
          "i’m not too sure how accurate it is, but i thought i would say that their shipping company, “Shipt,” is god horrible. I ordered for same day delivery for a steering wheel for my brother, and for it to be delivered to the wrong house. Not only to the wrong house, but nobody in my neighborhood had a front porch that looked like the picture they sent me of my package. Personally i think the driver stole it for himself, because Best Buy conducted an “investigation” just to be told i would not be provided a refund. It drove me crazy because all it would take is just for someone to google my front porch and the front porch of the house my package was delivered to, which literally looked like an apartment complex, This was the first and last time I will ever order from best buy again. I personally would not order same day delivery if you plan to order.",
          "If you want your packages on time, simply do not order from this business. Take your business to Amazon, where packages come on time.",
          "hahaha this is the greatest joke in history. \n\nthe answer is NO - 100% NO. my computer is already a day late and customer service via live chat and phone can't pin where the product is aside from \"it shipped from warehouse\". I was lucky enough to get that information, but of course NO delivery date on when to expect it. \n\nIt's asinine BestBuy limits the employees knowledge of their employees so they can only frustrate the customer even more. It's like it is on purpose. 'who knows where it is - you'll just have to sit back and wait. Oh well!\"\n\nBestBuy is pathetic, and a loser in the shipping world.",
          "Absolutely not. Out of all big companies Best Buy HANDS DOWN. Has the worst: delivery/ in store pickup system ever. Too focused on having staff oversell items to actually prioritize on the customers who make their business. I’ve bought Thousands upon thousands of dollars worth of items and never once felt satisfied by their services. I hope a new company with better business model beats them out in the future.",
          "I never had an issue with their shipping until I got my first experience with Shipt. Why are they using some instacart service with an independent contractor as the delivery person, I don't know because my item is marked delivered yet I did not receive anything. Checked my floor, checked the lobby, and checked the neighboring floors and nothing. Contacted Best Buy customer service and took me 4 attempts to get someone with a brain cell who knows what they are doing and told me I can follow up in 24 hours from the time of the supposed \"delivery\" for a re-issue of the purchase.",
          "wtfu bro",

          "I ordered a washer and dryer from Best Buy in Nov and it will be January in 3 days and still no washer or dryer. Supposedly they were shipped from the vendor. But I guess the vendor is taking the long route. Why is the SET never available? Why is there no way to track my order?? I am giving it a few more days and then I will be canceling.",
          "Totally not accurate. Why say it will be delivered the next day if that's not true.",
          "Never again… \nfirst, store pick up was cancelled so I ordered again and this time for shipping, guess what now its delayed.. BS..",
          "They have the absolute worst customer service.\nThe absolute worst customer service period.\nI ordered a sound bar December 2nd with an ETA of delivery on the 6th. It's now the 12th. They will give you the runaround like crazy through the chat and when you call customer service. No one will give you any information. A supervisor will put you right back into the standard queue. All of the representatives are incompetent. I made my last purchase from Best Buy. If it's not available in the store, don't waste your time. Complete trash in terms of service. You will find that Best Buy is on the way out and this is the reason. Amazon for life.",
          "when is #1123324317270 scheduled to be delivered",

          "Very frustrated.  Seems like bait and switch to say \"order in the next ... to get delivery by...\" then do not honor when you have enticed the purchase. Not good business practice.",
          "Best Buy is complete garage.  It's unlikely you'll ever get your order.  Worst company on planet Earth.",
          "heck no.  Never buy anything here because the shipping is absolute crap.  I needed a dji tello in 3 days and it said next day shipping.  Sounds awesome right?  Well they delayed the heck out of it.  ITS BEEN A WEEK!!!  NOW IM ABOUT TO BE FIRED FROM MY DRONE FILMING JOB!!!  My mavic mini se just got a broken camera and this is what i get???  Speed up or im never buying again):&lt;",
          "Never accurate. I bought my boyfriend a switch for his birthday and it was supposed to be next day delivery (Saturday). The day it was supposed to get delivered, never got any updates from FedEx or Best Buy giving me a new delivery date since it was going to be delayed. It wasn’t until Monday night when I received all the shipping updates, so my package had been moving some while with FedEx but not that much. I’m not sure if it’s a problem with FedEx or Best Buy but to go 2 and a half days without any updates then to get updates simply the night before delivery is upsetting.",
          "BestBuy pick up date is super inaccurate. I was supposed get my laptop today but earlier I checked in the app the bar wasn’t even half way through. They don’t even doubt about telling me what day it’s going to come after saying it’s delayed either.",
          "BestBuy delivered my MacBook Air right on time",

          "Delivery is late. Customer service for online orders is horrible! You cant believe what they say, some will talk over you and not allow you to complete your question or explain why you are calling. Most have such a heavy foriegn accent that they are difficult to understand. I will not make purchases online again.",
          "Delaying orders and refusing to talk to you about it seems to be a common practice for Best Buy.",
          "Ordered a laptop online and it said it would come a certain day, so I waited and then they said it would come tomorrow so I waited again now they say it will come the next day. In conclusion, their shipping estimate is HIGHLY inaccurate, and you should expect it to be wrong. I am sorry to say that I will NEVER ordering from BestBuy.com EVER again.",

Yet another experience giving me buyers remorse and a vow to never give them my money again. Smh",
          "Nope. Don’t. Ordered for same day delivery and i haven’t received it yet. It shows that it’s out for delivery still but it’s currently now 10:09pm….. they haven’t even updated me if it’s delayed or not? Can’t call customer service because they closed at 7pm.",
          "Kinda, I once ordered a laptop online and had it for next day delivery. It came around 6 pm which was really late but the funny thing is thay they gave it to my neighbors but I was able to recover it.",

          "The MacBook Pro has slightly better battery life, GPU, speakers, and microphone, and screen brightness.. The MacBook Pro also has the Touch Bar, but the Air just has a regular row of function keys. Another pretty big difference is that the MacBook Air has no fans where as the MacBook Pro does have fans.",
          "Very Similar! The main differences that I can see are that you have more USB ports on the Pro, and you are able to run the pro without the processor throttling down to a slower speed because of thermal issues. Basically, the Pro has a Fan, the Air doesn't. \r\n\r\nI bought the Air with 8gb, however ive decided to return it for a Pro with 16gb. I thought 8 would be enough, but it turns out After Effects needs a lot of ram.",
          "The MacBook Pro also provides 2 hours of extra battery life. The performance (all-around) will be better on the Pro as the Air uses a software-throttling system to control heat, which means if there's a scenario where a fan would be required to cool the machine, the Air will simply throttle the CPU/GPU as a way to deter or alleviate heat."

          "It has a new processor designed by Apple called the M1. It is stated to be faster and more efficient than the Intel's they sell. There are a few little changes, this is just the largest change.",
          "The MacBook Air (Late 2020) has the new Apple M1 chip. It is proven by YouTubers to have superb performance and efficiency compared to Intel and AMD CPUs. If you can, do not buy any Intel MacBook. Get this new M1 MacBook Air, or get the M1 MacBook Pro 13 inch. If you want an even higher end model, just wait as Apple plans to transition its entire Mac lineup to Apple Silicon. Apple’s processors are insanely good, they’ve been doing it for a decade on iPhone, iPad, and Apple Watch, so it looks to be paying off on the Mac. All of your apps still work too - as unoptimized apps run under Apple’s special emulation; which often is faster than when it runs natively on Intel. If you don’t know what that means, just know that all of your apps will work on this MacBook with absolutely no major issues. Hope this helps!",
          "The M1 uses Apple's own chip which is faster than the intel i3 or i5. I had purchased an i3 a few days before the M1 dropped (didn't know this version was coming out) and the i3 was heating up doing casual activities (browsing, typing, a few tabs open) and the fan kicked in which was a bit loud. I didn't want to deal with a hot laptop and loud fan noises so I returned my i3 for the M1 and what a difference! The battery life is outstanding as lasts pretty much all day (and then some) without needing a charge and the M1 version is super fast. The reviews on YouTube are true so I would recommend watching some reviews if you are still unsure. I am so happy with the M1 and it doesn't have a fan which means no fan noises and my M1 has been cool with multiple tabs open, browsing, and streaming music/videos. I hope this helps.",
