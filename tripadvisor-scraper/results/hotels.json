It is next to a VERY \"Commercial\" part of town (in other words there is a mcds and burger king just round the corner + surrounded by lots of high rise apartments), if you want to go somewhere that feels quaint or authentic then just bare in mind there may be better locations elsewhere on the island!\nHowever Sliema is a very good location in regards to being near everything and some of the other parts of town are very picturesque to be fair.

      "text": "Where do I even begin?\n\n1926 Hotel and Spa has been one of the best experiences of our stay in Malta.\n\nMy husband and I visited Malta for our honeymoon and also for a friend's wedding. From the moment we stepped foot into the hotel, the service was exceptional and has remained so throughout our stay. \nWe were offered prosecco whilst checking in by the wonderful staff on reception; who were very friendly, yet professional. They then duly accompanied us with our luggage, to the room. Though this may be normal for a 4 star hotel, we were very grateful as my husband is disabled and I appreciated the extra assistance; which was one of the reasons why we first fell in love with the hotel.\n\nWe booked a superior room, which was adequately sized for our stay of 10 days and the bed was more than big enough even for us, who are of larger stature. The shower amenities were absolutely gorgeous and smelt fantastic! We would have taken them home if could. \nThe only negatives I had for the room were, there was no mirror on or near the dressing table and so had to keep going back and forth to the full length mirror to do my make up. \nThe second was on the website they advertised Netflix, however this is only provided on the small tablet, which was very quiet and cannot be casted to the TV. Ideally, if this is something you would want then I'd advise to bring an Amazon firestick or Google chrome cast. \nLastly, more storage for underwear would be helpful as there isn't anywhere really to store them. \nOverall, the room was very quiet which is a huge positive for us as we are light sleepers and the cleaners did a fantastic job on presenting the room every day. We loved the little gifts and messages that were left at the evening turndown (we didn't pay extra for this), which we felt was a lovely, considerate touch.\n\nEvery morning we were greeted with nothing but smiles by all staff and they were always happy to help, no matter how big or small a request. We would like to give a special mention to Alex who was one of the duty managers. He always had time to chat with us and made us feel really welcome.\n\nBreakfast,  though repetitive, was plentiful and of good quality. One day we asked for fried eggs rather than the scrambled that's offered, which they were happy to provide. We absolutely loved that the orange juice was freshly squeezed every day! \nAgain, the breakfast staff were very attentive and friendly and kept the breakfast stations immaculate and replenished. The second special mention is for Antionette who was one of the restaurant supervisors. She provided exceptional service and we loved listening to her experiences. \n\nLastly, The Beach Club. Wow. What a stunning addition to the hotel. We loved the filtered salt water infinity pool and its spectacular view. We can see why it is popular for the social media influencer wannabe's. My husband thoroughly enjoyed the sushi, which is fantastic value for money!!!\n\nOverall, we want to thank everyone at the 1926 hotel in making our honeymoon an unforgettable and delightful experience. If it hadn't of been for the hotel, we do not believe we would have enjoyed our stay half as much as we have.",

The rooms are simple but good sized \n\nYes, you aren’t on the seafront and the views aren’t amazing from the balconies, but do a two minute walk from the hotel and you’re in the seafront where the views are wonderful \n\nWe were lucky to catch the beach club opening properly for the start of the season, it had a basic bar but the service was immaculate - Jay was a lovely member of staff we dealt with \nThe pool wasn’t warm but the sun is so it was great to cool off in! \n\nWe tried the hotel pool too and loved that it was warm, there was bubble spots too, and lay down section which was comfy, they also had a sauna and steam room (both weren’t the best sadly the sauna needs the wood planks replaced as they’re wearing away and the steam rooms door wasn’t sealing properly) other than that they spa attendants were lovely and very welcoming! The spa itself was very clean and relaxing- we loved the tiled warm beds! \n\nThe breakfast at the hotel was great and lots of options to choose from, perfect for the morning to set yourself up with, they even have Prosecco to mix with orange juice! \n\nThe surrounding area is nice, plenty of restaurants to choose from and easy to get around \n\nHighly recommend downloading Bolt to use the scooters and the taxis to go anywhere on island, it’s very easy to use! Much like Uber! ",

      "text": "Pros - nice area, free glass of bubbly on arrival, free bottle of wine  in room on arrival\nCons - some  of the rooms are dated, we had a room for 3 adults where one of us had to sleep on a sofa bed, beach club pool is so busy and pool looks smaller than in pictures \n\nOur stay was so-so. We are 3 adult females and had requested in advance to have  two double beds in our room rather than one of the family rooms with one double bed and a sofa bed (mostly to avoid the argument  over who gets the bed vs a sofa!) as well as to have a room on a higher floor  with the sea view if possible. Upon checking into our room we were disappointed to see that we had actually been given a bed and a sofa bed and although we were on the  10th floor and could see the  sea I wouldn't really call it a sea view more a buildings And construction plus a little bit of sea view. This was the first disappointment followed by our toilet not flushing and  the toilet button cover coming off of the wall. We called the reception to make them aware of this and they told us they'd send someone up soon (an hour later someone came and fixed it). We later were able to speak to the manager who we discussed all the  above disappointments with who informed us that we had a lot of requests so they gave us the  best view rather than the 2 beds... Shame as the  beds were more important and the view really wasn't that great! (I wish when you stayed in hotels you didn't have to make  any requests because all the  rooms are equally nice but unfortunately this is never the case and  I always check TripAdvisor in advance for room tips. )He was nice and agreed that we could switch rooms the following day because now all the rooms were occupied and  I have  to say the second room we were given was 1000x's better! It was much bigger, had two beds as requested, all the fittings in the room were more modern and overall was what we had initially expected from the  hotel. The view was of the inner courtyard but to be honest we didnt mind it at all as previously mentioned we didn't have an amazing  sea view before anyway. The hotel is nice and I don't regret staying here, so if you are coming with more than 2 people just request the two double beds and don't expect a great sea view. \nOverall, Would we return? Probably not because we wouldn't  want to risk having the sofa bed room again (no one pays for a nice hotel to sleep on a sofa on holiday sorry). I think if we had the room we requested on arrival I might have a different opinion on this hotel but sadly very underwhelming and disappointing.",

      "text": "I cannot thank the 1926 Hotel enough for not only providing my friend and I with a lovely and relaxed holiday but their incredible card of me when I was unwell.\nOn our first morning I accidentally consumed something with nuts in, which I am allergic to. Sometime later, I went into shock and needed to go to hospital. I have to call out especially Liselle (?) and for her immediate care and kindness to me. She did not leave my side until further help arrived, fanning me and loosening my clothes. I will never forget her kindness! The duty manager (sorry I don't know your name) was also very calm and efficient in calling for help and getting an ambulance arranged. I was in such good hands. \nAfter coming back from the hospital, they called our room twice over the next day to check we were alright and could not do enough for us. \nAside from this, the spa was wonderful, with very good treatments, especially the massage, and breakfast has plenty of variety and was fresh and tasty. \nCan I just mention the only small fault is the hairdryers in the room, they are awful and useless to anyone with long hair. \nThe beach club opened while we were there and is very well staffed, and again, everyone is very attentive. \nAll the staff are very polite and smiley and, to reiterate, could not do enough for us. I am very appreciative of everything this did for me!",

Bathroom spotless lovely modern shower plenty complimentary toiletries good hair dryer . Room was a good size wardrobe had plenty space and were very clean inside no dust anywhere. Cleaners were always in corridor and always asked if we needed more cleaning done lifts snd corridors immaculate aswell. Can’t comment on restaurant spa or bar as we never used them but these areas looked as good as the rest of hotel . We Used hotel as a base to explore Malta overall I can’t fault the 1946 the only slight moan I have the pool which is situated at beach club over the road was closed I think it was being refurbished for the up coming season weather wasn’t great so this wasn’t to much of a disappointment.

      "text": "I wanted to love it here, on the surface its a great looking hotel with an excellent location.\nWe begin our journey from the UK at 2am and arrived at the hotel just after 11am looking forward to check into our room. We didn't find the welcome particularly warm and friendly, we were advised our room would not be ready until 3pm.   When you have been travelling for hours you just want to get to your room, appreciate maybe a short wait but not hours, I've never in my whole 30 years of travel experienced this.\nWe made our way to the beach club to get lunch.  25 minutes we waited for a drink and there was no one in it so unsure what was going on, a further 20 minutes for a salad, which to be fair was nice.\nWhen we eventually checked into our room it was lovely, modern and clean. However a real lack of any drawers to put your clothes in. No mirror near the dressing table and only one chair on the balcony, no storage in the bathroom.\nIt became apparent after our first night the walls were paper thin, I could hear a gentleman snoring very loudly every night which didn't make for a good night's sleep.\nWe tried the bar. I ordered a cocktail, my husband a pint we we told to go to a table and they would bring it over. \nMy husbands drink was pulled immediately but sat on the bar going flat whilst my cocktail was prepared.  It took over 20 minutes to make the cocktail which showed no resemblance to what I ordered when it arrived.  I questioned this and was told they didn't have the ingredients so put something else in it. It wasn't pleasant I left it and we didn't pay for it.  Again it wasnt over busy in the bar so not sure why it was so slow. What I found astounding was the plethora of staff on reception but the lack of them in the bar or anywhere else.\nBreakfast was varied and plentiful, however the hot items were never hot, and one toast machine for the whole hotel was a bit lax.\nThe cleaner was absolutely lovely the best member of staff there and did an excellent job, a real credit to the hotel and we appreciated his hard work.\nWhen we checked out we were never even asked how our stay had been or to have a good journey home.  Just another example of a real lack of warmth.\nWe had a nice holiday in Malta but not because of the hotel.  It makes me sad to leave negative comments, but just found the whole experience a bit flat.\n",

      "text": "We wanted some winter sun, Malta not the hottest place to go in February but overall the weather didn't disappoint. The hotel's location in Sliema is very convenient for the ferry to Valletta and bus routes across the island. It's not the most pretty area but the hotel does not disappoint. The reception and the staff are both smart and welcoming. The rooms are exceptionally clean and there is a very pleasant turn down service most evenings. All the staff we encountered were very friendly and courteous. The balconies are tiny so a bit disappointed with that. The spa area is very pleasant, make the most of it, As we were out of season the beach club was closed - it does look spectacular but as we couldn't use it cannot comment (and they use the pictures a lot!). The breakfast service and choice is good but as we were there for over a week it does become a tad monotonous. \nHowever, overall we would highly recommend 1926 Hotel and Spa, good value, good facilities and great staff.",

During the days of our stay we noticed, or at least the way we experienced it, that there was insufficient air-circulation. So even when it was cold(er), we left the heating off for a better nights' sleep!\n\nBreakfast was various, with many options & very clean. A downside was that you could only pick standard egg-dishes, different ones (ie 'an omelet) came at an extra price, which is awkward if you're already forking out fgor a suite, but hey, when you feel like it, you will order it anyway we thought!",
