Spa: Spa was open from 9am - 9pm i believe and no slot booking was required! Spa pool is heated and has jets. There is a sauna and steam room and 2 heated loungers you can lay on. Heated loungers also had cleaning spray next to them so you could wipe down the loungers before laying on them. Robes and slippers are provided in your rooms - can use to go to spa in.

The rooms on 3rd floor were clean and comfortable, balcony was looking to side street we didn't utilise as went out and about every day. Switch besides bed for do not disturb or make-up my room signs outside and code for door I thought were brilliant. Housekeeping team great. Thanks Maricel.

Issues ranged from inefficient processes to lackluster customer support. Overall, a regrettable choice for accommodation",

The hotel has a separate area on the sea front with a pool, bar and restaurant, which is great though it closed abruptly midweek while we were there. They also put on a free tour to Mdina in a vintage bus, which was great and a nice touch.  Sliema is very built up but there's a lovely promenade walk and you're never far from restaurants and shops. There's a quick ferry to Valetta, which is definitely worth a visit.   Really nice stay, and again, the staff",

Already upon arrival, the check-in procedure is complicated!  There are 3 persons at the desk, but you have to download an app on your phone and register online.  So stupid, as they had to help us with that as it didn't work on my iPhone.  We had a standard room, with a \"great\" view on the interior court and were basically nose to nose to the building in front of us.   The room was very dark, and without any sunlight. When you sat on the balcony, you were just above the breakfast tables! Early morning you can hear the people at breakfast moving around chairs, talk, etc.  Not suited for people who want to sleep.

We stayed in room 901 ( I think). This was a spacious, bright and airy room, wih a partial sea view. Be aware that the hotel is situated in quite a narrow street, amid appartment buildings of several storeys. This means that if you’re staying on lower floors, it’s likely that your room will be darker, with obscured views, so ask for a high floor. We had a good balcony, too, which was relaxing. Furnishings are minimal, but sufficient, with open hanging space  and no drawers. We don’t pack light and managed ok. The bed and pillows were very confortable, bed linen was fresh. Plenty of",

This was a birthday trip and after a slight mishap with the 'birthday set-up' in the room, the issue was resolved by hotel staff. Hotel breakfast was not the best, it tasted quite cheap for 15Euro pp.  The hotel bar wasn't the best as they didn't have ingredients for any of the cocktails that were requested from the menu! After 3 different cocktail choices, a vodka and orange was ordered.  One of them was a mojito! How can a bar run out of a classic? The Beach Club was great, the",
